## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MrMajharul/algorithm.git
   cd algorithms
 ```

2. Compile and run individual algorithms using a terminal or Java IDE:
   ```bash
   javac src/graph/BFS.java
   java src.graph.BFS
   ```

3. You can also run `Main.java` (if present) as an entry point to test all algorithms.
